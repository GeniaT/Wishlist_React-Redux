- Make sure the auth pop up doesn't appear if there user is still in memory or logged to the app.
- Remove items details from 'wishlists/ids/items', need to store only itemsIds at this reference.
  - Actually for now, it leave that way so the fetch is easier from DB. When we decide to modify this, need to update the fetch fct.
- remove the if/else in wishlist & event container state init. Instead, use xx||yy for update/create scenario.
- add proptypes in my components/containers.
