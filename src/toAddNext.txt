- Make sure the auth pop up doesn't appear if there user is still in memory or logged to the app.
- add proptypes in my components/containers.
- Investigate why firebase.auth() doesn't work as expected on mobile device.

- make the "add participants suggestions" dynamic while I add participants. If there are 2 suggestions and I add one participant,
  the number of suggestions should now be 1.
- when deleting or adding a friend, add/delete as well from the other person DB so the link is bidirectional
