- Make sure the auth pop up doesn't appear if there user is still in memory or logged to the app.
- Make the initial app rendering dynamic based on fetching/logged in/logged off status of the user.
- Remove items details from 'wishlists/ids/items', need to store only itemsIds at this reference.
  - Actually for now, it leave that way so the fetch is easier from DB. When we decide to modify this, need to update the fetch fct.
- Remove the copy of arguments in various firebase actions.
