1/To solve: the events are not checked even if the wishlist is linked to certain events.
  How: add a check logic in the wishlist form based on what events is the wishlist linked to.
  When: When the events in info of the wishlist are generated based on Redux state and existing events in the app.
2/ when setting a title on a wishlist, make sure its unique before validating it.
  If not, alert the user to choose a new title.
3/ Add wishlists check logic on events creation => Check for wishlists in the state and display them in events creation.
