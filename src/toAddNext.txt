1/To solve: the events are not checked even if the wishlist is linked to certain events.
  How: add a check logic in the wishlist form based on what events is the wishlist linked to.
  When: When the events in info of the wishlist are generated based on Redux state and existing events in the app.

2/To Add: Items information to modal for their updates. Atm, nothing is displayed while the info is in the local and global state.
