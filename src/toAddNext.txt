1/To solve: the events are not checked even if the wishlist is linked to certain events.
  How: add a check logic in the wishlist form based on what events is the wishlist linked to.
  When: When the events in info of the wishlist are generated based on Redux state and existing events in the app.
2/avoid saving duplicate wishlists (SAVE_WISHLIST)
