- Make sure the auth pop up doesn't appear if there user is still in memory or logged to the app.
- Remove items details from 'wishlists/ids/items', need to store only itemsIds at this reference.
  - Actually for now, it leave that way so the fetch is easier from DB. When we decide to modify this, need to update the fetch fct.

- test by having multiple wishlists and events and then from dashboard, delete everything.
  - the DB may not be totally updated with many actions triggered that way. Need to check where may be the issue
- update eventsContainer and events component to run the delete the way the save works in events/wishlists containers.
