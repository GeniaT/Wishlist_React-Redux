# Wishlist App

We all struggle when thinking about what gifts would interest my friends or family.
This app is an attempt to make your life a bit easier by:
- listing the wish lists of your friends
- creating events and add wish lists and other items to it
- give enough information about each item to make it easy to find and order the item
